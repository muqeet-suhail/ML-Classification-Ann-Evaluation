# 🎯 Career Interest Classification Using Machine Learning & ANN 🤖

Welcome to **Career Interest Classifier**, a project that predicts career paths based on age, interests, and related features using multiple machine learning models and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

<h3> 🚀 Key Features </h3>

1. 🔍 Robust handling of missing data and categorical encoding  
2. 📊 Feature scaling and filtering to handle class imbalance  
3. 🤖 Model training and evaluation with:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Naive Bayes  
   - Random Forest  
   - Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras  
4. 📈 Comprehensive performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
5. 🎨 Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualizations for all models  

<h3>  🛠 How It Works </h3> 

1. 📂 Load and preprocess the dataset  
2. 🧠 Train multiple classification models on the processed data  
3. 📊 Evaluate and visualize each model’s performance  
4. 🎯 Compare results to identify the best performing classifier  

<h3>  💻 Getting Started </h3> 

**To get started, simply open and run the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., VS Code).**

The notebook contains the complete workflow from data loading, preprocessing, model training, to evaluation and visualization.
